# Introduction #

Once the product is in place, your customers will never hear “Sorry the item is sold out” after ordering the item. System is intelligent enough to handle the inventory of the items, so if the item is not available, customers will see a disabled item which they will not be able to order.
With the system keeping a tab of the items your customer wants to order, there will never be a case when customers get something which they never ordered. They will see the list of items right in front of their eyes before placing the order.

**Personalized food items**
Customers can personalize the item before placing the order; they can attach a note
regarding their preferences for the item like less salt, less spicy etc.
